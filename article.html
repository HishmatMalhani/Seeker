    <center><h2 style="color: blue">The Meaning of Fearless Mastery</h2></center>
    <center><h4>This week, we’ve opened up enrollment for my deepest program, Fearless Mastery. <br> It’s 20 or so people coming together to support each other’s meaningful work in community, <br> and to get supported by me and our other coaches. <br>

        The name “Fearless Mastery” brings up a lot of uncertainty in people, <br> a lot of preconceived notions. So I thought I’d talk about <br> what’s behind that name.
        <br> <br>
        Let’s start with each word — Fearless and Mastery — before we talk about the overall idea.</h4></center>


        <center><h2 style="color: blue">The Meaning of Fearlessness</h2></center>
        <center><h4>The word “fearless” might seem to imply an absence of fear … but what it <br> really means is courage in the face of fear. <br> 
          <br>  When I talk about “fearlessness,” I’m talking about the ability to be with <br> your fear. To face it, to rest your attention on it, to stay with it, to become <br>intimate with your fear. <br>
          This is a completely different relationship with fear than most people have. <br> Usually we want to get away from fear, to fix the situation so we don’t have to feel fear, <br> or to get rid of our fear through different solutions or practices. <br>

         <br> My training is to turn towards the fear and be with it. Over and over. <br> Until it loses significance, and becomes just an old friend showing up. <br>
          
          Our lives change when we have this kind of fearlessness — we are no longer controlled by fears, <br> and in fact can find meaning and joy and play in the middle of  uncertainty. <br> </h4></center>
          <center><h2 style="color: blue">The Process of Mastery</h2></center>
          <center><h4>When people hear the word “mastery” they think that you need to be a master to have mastery. <br> You need to be an expert, to have pro-level skills. <br>

            That’s not what I mean when I speak of “mastery.” <br> In my training, “mastery” is the process of mastering something. <br> Deepening into your training and really staying in the place of learning, curiosity, not knowing. <br>
            
            “Mastery” in this approach is the opposite of being an expert — <br> it’s having Beginner’s Mind, and being willing to stay in the process of becoming. <br>
            
            Mastery is a process, not an end point. <br> It’s a deepening into, not a final state. Mastery is where the deepest growth takes place, <br> where we become our most authentic selves. <br></h4></center>

            <center><h2 style="color: blue">The Possibility of Fearless Mastery</h2></center>
            <center><h4>When we put these ideas together, we have Fearless Mastery — <br> a process of deepening into the training of fearlessness, of getting intimate <br> with fear and creating a new relationship to uncertainty.

                In this process, we are willing to let go of ego and humble ourselves. <br> We’re willing to make mistakes, fall on our faces, and admit we don’t know. <br> We’re willing to take a look at our patterns, and stay in the discomfort for a little bit longer. <br> It’s a beautiful process of taking full responsibility for what we want to create in our lives. <br>
                
               <br> When we fully surrender to this process, something emerges that doesn’t happen when we stay at the surface or stay in safety. <br> It’s our fullest selves. Our deepest meaning. Our greatest love.</h4></center>
