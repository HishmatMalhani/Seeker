        “After her first two weeks observing the problems at Decision Tech, Kathryn Petersen, its new CEO, had more than a few moments when she wondered if she should have taken the job.” And so begins the story of a technology company struggling to grow and find customers. Executives are not working together as a team, and the team is struggling to come to agreement on the necessary strategy to solve the problems. The team’s dynamics erodes into the blame game, and no one is willing to accept responsibility. Deadlines are missed and moral is deteriorating.<br>

        In Patrick Lencioni’s New York Times best-seller, The Five Dysfunctions of a Team, he walks you through a short and easy to read fable about a team’s struggles to work as a team, and how they used his five behaviors model to become an exceptional and effective team. Lencioni is the author of five nationally recognized books and CEO of The Table Group, a management consulting firm specializing in executive team development and organizational health.
        
        Lencioni presents his case that for a CEO to get a team aligned and rowing in the same direction he/she needs to address five dysfunctions.
        <br>I would highly recommend Patrick Lencioni’s book to any leader that wants to increase the effectiveness of their leadership team. It provides an easy to understand and practical advice on building teamwork.

<pre><h1 style="color: blue;">                                    THE LAST LECTURE BY RANDY PAUSCH            </h1></pre>

        <h2>
            A lot of professors give talks titled 'The Last Lecture'. Professors are asked to consider their demise and to ruminate on what matters most to them: What wisdom would we impart to the world if we knew it was our last chance? If we had to vanish tomorrow, what would we want as our legacy?

When Randy Pausch, a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon, was asked to give such a lecture, he didn't have to imagine it as his last, since he had recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer. But the lecture he gave, 'Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams', wasn't about dying. It was about the importance of overcoming obstacles, of enabling the dreams of others, of seizing every moment (because time is all you have and you may find one day that you have less than you think). It was a summation of everything Randy had come to believe. It was about living.

In this book, Randy Pausch has combined the humour, inspiration, and intelligence that made his lecture such a phenomenon and given it an indelible form. It is a book that will be shared for generations to come. 
<br> I highly recommend you this book.

        <pre><h1 style="color: blue;">                             OUTLIERS: THE STORY OF SUCCESS BY MALCOLM GLADWELL           </h1></pre>

               <h2>
                In this stunning book, Malcolm Gladwell takes us on an intellectual journey through the world of "outliers"--the best and the brightest, the most famous and the most successful. He asks the question: what makes high-achievers different?

                His answer is that we pay too much attention to what successful people are like, and too little attention to where they are from: that is, their culture, their family, their generation, and the idiosyncratic experiences of their upbringing. Along the way he explains the secrets of software billionaires, what it takes to be a great soccer player, why Asians are good at math, and what made the Beatles the greatest rock band.
                
                Brilliant and entertaining, Outliers is a landmark work that will simultaneously delight and illuminate.

                     <pre> <h4 style="color: blue;"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Think-Grow-Rich-Landmark-Bestseller/dp/1585424331" target="_blank" >click to go through the whole book</a></h4></pre>
<h2>


    Think and Grow Rich has been called the "Granddaddy of All Motivational Literature." It was the first book to boldly ask, "What makes a winner?" The man who asked and listened for the answer, Napoleon Hill, is now counted in the top ranks of the world's winners himself.
The most famous of all teachers of success spent "a fortune and the better part of a lifetime of effort" to produce the "Law of Success" philosophy that forms the basis of his books and that is so powerfully summarized in this one.

In the original Think and Grow Rich, published in 1937, Hill draws on stories of Andrew Carnegie, Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and other millionaires of his generation to illustrate his principles. In the updated version, Arthur R. Pell, Ph.D., a nationally known author, lecturer, and consultant in human resources management and an expert in applying Hill's thought, deftly interweaves anecdotes of how contemporary millionaires and billionaires, such as Bill Gates, Mary Kay Ash, Dave Thomas, and Sir John Templeton, achieved their wealth. Outmoded or arcane terminology and examples are faithfully refreshed to preclude any stumbling blocks to a new generation of readers.
